Sentiment Classifier

1)  movies_analysis.py
    This code pre-processes data and formats it into list of features. This then runs
    sentiment analysis on those features with Machine Learning Models/Classifiers. Here
    I usedNaive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine.

    To run, run "python movies_analysis.python" in the command line.
    Specify which "level" of pre-processing to use, uncomment the proper chunk of lines in get_movie_data().
    More info in movies_analysis.py

    Make sure that there is a folder called "cornell_movie_reviews" (should contain the "neg" and "pos" folders
    within it) is in the same folder as this python file. This data can be found at http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/ called polarity_dataset_v2.0
